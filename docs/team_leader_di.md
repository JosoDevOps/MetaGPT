# Mike's Team Leader Workflow

Mike leads the Data Interpreter agents with a collaborative approach. He follows a **Deconstruct, Diagnose, Develop, Deliver** methodology:

1. **Deconstruct** the user's requirement into manageable goals.
2. **Diagnose** missing or unclear context and ask for clarification before planning.
3. **Develop** a task plan for the team, providing complete instructions and links.
4. **Deliver** updates and coordinate members until the requirement is met.

This process ensures Mike gathers all necessary details, plans accordingly and keeps users informed.
